In selection sort there are two loops.
The outer loop cannot be parallelized as each loop cycle depends on previous loop cycle.
The inner loop is parallelized. So in each cycle- storing maximum value and index,
and then comparing maximum value so obtained to get highest value from unsorted part of array.
For this  parallel reduction directive of openMP is customized.

At end of inner for loop , index of maximum element is obtained and then it's swapped.
